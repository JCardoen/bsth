abstract = {Modern indoor positioning system services are important technologies that play vital roles in modern life, providing many services such as recruiting emergency healthcare providers and for security purposes. Several large companies, such as Microsoft, Apple, Nokia, and Google, have researched location-based services. Wireless indoor localization is key for pervasive computing applications and network optimization. Different approaches have been developed for this technique using WiFi signals. WiFi fingerprinting-based indoor localization has been widely used due to its simplicity, and algorithms that fingerprint WiFi signals at separate locations can achieve accuracy within a few meters. However, a major drawback of WiFi fingerprinting is the variance in received signal strength (RSS), as it fluctuates with time and changing environment. As the signal changes, so does the fingerprint database, which can change the distribution of the RSS (multimodal distribution). Thus, in this paper, we propose that symmetrical H{\"{o}}lder divergence, which is a statistical model of entropy that encapsulates both the skew Bhattacharyya divergence and Cauchy-Schwarz divergence that are closed-form formulas that can be used to measure the statistical dissimilarities between the same exponential family for the signals that have multivariate distributions. The H{\"{o}}lder divergence is asymmetric, so we used both left-sided and right-sided data so the centroid can be symmetrized to obtain the minimizer of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results showed that the symmetrized H{\"{o}}lder divergence consistently outperformed the traditional k nearest neighbor and probability neural network. In addition, with the proposed algorithm, the position error accuracy was about 1 m in buildings.},

abstract = {The Cisco {\textregistered} Hyperlocation solution delivers unprecedented average Wi-Fi client location accuracy of 1 to 3 meters. The solution is powered through a combination of four Cisco technologies: • Cisco Aironet {\textregistered} 4800 Access Point • Cisco DNA Spaces • Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) Location Engine • CMX SDK Product overview The same business and personal benefits that GPS and mobile map services have brought to the outdoors are now being realized in the indoor enterprise space. The applications are numerous, and they include wayfinding and proximity engagement in malls, hospitals, and hotels; flexible employee workspace use; tracking wait times at airport security lines; and retail product placement. To date, the solutions that cater to these applications have multiple challenges and limitations, such as coarse 5-to 10-meter accuracy and slow location refresh, along with nonstandard, expensive approaches using video and RF technology. Occasionally, these solutions cleverly use battery-powered Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons that, although simple in concept, are logistically and operationally onerous. The Cisco Hyperlocation solution introduces hardware and software innovation that can deliver 1-to 3-meter location accuracy on average for associated Wi-Fi clients. The foundation of the solution is the next-generation Cisco Aironet 4800 Access Point. The access point has our proven Hyperlocation antenna array and an additional Wi-Fi radio built into the unit. Using a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the angle of arrival supported through this technology, you can triangulate the location of associated Wi-Fi mobile clients and BLE devices with pinpoint accuracy. The access point also provides a hassle-free BLE beacon deployment that is powered over Ethernet and centrally managed from the convenience of a data center. As a result, local IT engineers do not need to perform walk-by inspections of BLE beacon health using applications on their smart devices. By combining BLE signal and location data from the Hyperlocation antenna in the Aironet 4800 with sensors on the mobile client, location can be determined to within 1 to 3 meters on average, in near real time.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The research and use of positioning and navigation technologies outdoors has seen a steady and exponential growth. Based on this success, there have been attempts to implement these technologies indoors, leading to numerous studies. Most of the algorithms, techniques and technologies used have been implemented outdoors. However, how they fare indoors is different altogether. Thus, several technologies have been proposed and implemented to improve positioning and navigation indoors. Among them are Infrared (IR), Ultrasound, Audible Sound, Magnetic, Optical and Vision, Radio Frequency (RF), Visible Light, Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR)/Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Hybrid. The RF technologies include Bluetooth, Ultra-wideband (UWB), Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) and Near Field Communication (NFC). In addition, positioning techniques applied in indoor positioning systems include the signal properties and positioning algorithms. The prevalent signal properties are Angle of Arrival (AOA), Time of Arrival (TOA), Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), while the positioning algorithms are Triangulation, Trilateration, Proximity and Scene Analysis/ Fingerprinting. This paper presents a state-of-the-art survey of indoor positioning and navigation systems and technologies, and their use in various scenarios. It analyses distinct positioning technology metrics such as accuracy, complexity, cost, privacy, scalability and usability. This paper has profound implications for future studies of positioning and navigation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

ABSTRACT In this paper we have presented an indoor positioning system for pedestrians combining Wireless LAN fingerprinting with foot mounted inertial and magnetometer sensors. To achieve a system capable of real-time processing we have employed a hierarchical Bayesian filtering approach using cascaded extended Kalman filters. The accuracy of the combined system was quantitatively evaluated in a real building against ground-truth. Our results show that accuracy is much higher than using Wireless LAN fingerprinting alone; in our experiment we achieved a positioning error (standard deviation) of roughly 1.6 meters. The approach requires only minimal fingerprinting effort since the high accuracy is achieved by the support of the inertial-based step estimation in the overall estimation process.},

abstract = {This document details the procedure involved in using the Hyperlocation add-ons to the Cisco 3600 and Cisco 3700 Access Points to calculate the location of Wi-Fi clients. The Cisco Hyperlocation module utilizes the Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) information gathered from a phase-array antenna to locate associated Wi-Fi clients more precisely and quickly than traditional RSSI based location solutions. The overall system that include the Cisco Hyperlocation modules requires a combination of a specific version of the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) that enables the gathering of measurements from the phase-array antenna. A version of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) is required during the initial setup, but is not a part of the ongoing location calculations. Cisco PI is used to record the placement or change in placement of the APs, including X, Y, height, and orientation. A version of Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) 10.2.2 is also required. Cisco CMX uses the locations of the Aps, the phase array data and RSSI data to calculate the location of an associated Wi-Fi client, which is then used by the Cisco CMX API or as an input for Cisco CMX Analytics.},

abstract = {Location based-services and personal navigation require the location determination of a user not only in outdoor environments but also indoor. For indoor location already established wireless infrastructure such as WLAN (Wireless Local Area Networks) can be employed. This approach has the advantage that no costly hardware installations are necessary inside a building if WLAN is already available. The IMST GmbH has developed a software framework called "ipos" for indoor positioning technologies. The principle of the developed platform and the performance of the location determination using WLAN in a localization testbed of IMST GmbH are presented in this paper.},

@article{Liu2019,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}An indoor logical network qualitatively represents abstract relationships between indoor spaces, and it can be used for path computation. In this paper, we concentrate on the logical network that does not have notions for metrics. Instead, it relies on the semantics and properties of indoor spaces. A navigation path can be computed by deriving parameters from these semantics and minimizing them in routing algorithms. Although previous studies have adopted semantic approaches to build logical networks, routing methods are seldom elaborated. The main issue with such networks is to derive criteria for path computation using the semantics of spaces. Here, we present a routing mechanism that is based on a dedicated space classification and a set of routing criteria. The space classification reflects characteristics of spaces that are important for navigation, such as horizontal and vertical directions, doors and windows, etc. Six routing criteria are introduced, and they involve: (1) the spaces with the preferred semantics; and/or (2) their centrality in the logical network. Each criterion is encoded as the weights to the nodes or edges of the logical network by considering the semantics of spaces. Logical paths are derived by a traditional shortest-path algorithm that minimizes these weights. Depending on the building's interior configuration, one criterion may result in several logical paths. Therefore, we introduce a priority ordering of criteria to support path selection and decrease the possible number of logical paths. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation for several buildings to demonstrate the usability of such a routing. The main benefit of this routing method is that it does not need geometric information to compute a path. The logical network can be created using verbal descriptions only, and this routing method can be applied to indoor spaces derived from any building subdivision.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Recently indoor positioning methods based on WLAN signal measurements gained popularity because of high localization accuracy. These methods exploit radio maps obtained from wireless signal measurement surveys on location grids. Measurement sets from various WLAN access points are called fingerprints and characterize locations where the measurements are collected. As WLAN environments do not ensure continuous measurements availability, and faulty or rogue access points may unexpectedly change surveyed signal patterns, resiliency becomes an important issue to address using algorithmic methods. This paper first proposes a general fault model that integrates several reported models. Then performance degradations due to faults are studied for conventional fingerprinting methods. Two improvements to positioning systems are proposed for mitigating the impact of faulty measurements. The first improvement takes into account the intermittent unavailability of AP samples when calculating kNN. The second improvement allows the system to switch from a high accuracy method that works only under normal conditions, to a more resilient method whenever a high number of faults are suspected. Performance figures are provided for positioning with data surveyed from a real environment, to which varying amounts of faults have been introduced artificially.},
