Hospitals use different applications for maintaining patients' information as well as scheduling appointments.
This is a rigid system that mostly generates long waiting queues which can be easily avoided using current technology.
Ever so often a patient has no idea where to go and simply follows the provided directions to the specific department
and spends more time finding the right doctor's room than in the actual appointment.
The main focus of this thesis is to implement an application that will enable the patient to skip the registration
process and limit time spent at the hospital by providing the user with an interactive map that will be a guide to
the place of appointment.
