\section{Hospital Mobile Application}
\subsection{Application}
The goal of this thesis is to develop a proof of concept (PoC) for a mobile application that can be used to schedule and manage appointments, routing inside of the hospital and registration upon arrival at the designated site. The routing is implemented using a service called MapWize \cite{MapWize.io2019} that transforms architectural plans into digital maps. Using these maps the geolocalization is integrated using Cisco CMX technology.
