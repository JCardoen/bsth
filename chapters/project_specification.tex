\section{Project Description}
The emphasis of the \acrshort{poc} is on developing it in such a way that it should be easy to re-implement the application elsewhere. The PoC is developed in the two current formats for mobile development: iOS and Android. This bachelor's thesis will cover the implementation of the Android architecture. Firstly the existing application is reworked from using the Ionic framework to a native mobile application (Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android). In addition to this part, geolocalization is implemented in the native mobile app using the MapWize service \cite{MapWize.io2019} and the IndoorLocation framework \cite{IndoorLocation.io2019}, both service provide working \acrfull{sdk} for iOS and Android. Finally the application is revised by the team of interns and the developers at IBM and uploaded onto the Apple Store and the Google Play Store.
\subsection{Technologies to research}
Throughout the development of the PoC, several technologies are used, such are: Android \acrshort{sdk}, authentication, RoomDB for offline storage, IBM BlueMix \acrshort{api}, \acrfull{uml}, dependency injection, MapWize, IndoorLocation and Cisco CMX.
