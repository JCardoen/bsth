\section{Project Description}
\subsection{Technical Design Specs}
The communication with the hospital happens with a server provided by IBM and the hospital's API. This means that the mobile device interacts with a intermediary server from IBM which in its turn communicates with the API of the hospital. This model is an example of a highly reusable architecture. If another hospital needs to be attached to the IBM server, only a small 'translator' for the endpoints of the additional hospital's API needs to be created whilst the structure of the IBM server remains the same.
\subsection{Features}
The main features of the project are specified below \cite{medappspec}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Login with hospital provided credentials;
\item Synchronization of appointments with the hospital;
\item Ability to set reminders for an appointment;
\item See the hospital's location (and venues) as well as contact details;
\item Allow geolocalization inside the hospital;
\item Provide feedback after an appointment;
\item Localization in French, English and Dutch;
\item Available on both iOS and Android
\item Distributed in the Apple Store and Google Play Store;
\end{enumerate}
\section{Development Guidelines}
To attain uniformity in the codebase of iOS and Android a 'Development Guidelines' document is written, this document can be found as an appendix.
