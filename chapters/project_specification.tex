\section{Project Description}
This bachelor's thesis covers a case study provided by IBM, related to an internship performed at IBM. This chapter will cover the case study, specific requirements and which technologies need to be researched and thus are handled in this paper.
\subsection{Case Study}
\subparagraph{Applied case: patient location-based services in a hospital}
A hospital is a good example of why an \acrshort{ips} can be useful. Many people spend time following the indicated route from the hospital's hall to the specific point of interest (operation room, intensive care, specific doctor's office etc.), however this requires a patient or visitor to constantly check his current location and is therefore intolerant for human mistakes. The routing inside a hospital is a prime example of a static route which is not adaptive to the visitor and does not offer real-time changes. This is where the application of an \acrshort{ips} can be a dynamic technology to guide the user inside the building. Another important note is the user's privacy: when using the \acrshort{pn} location-based services it ensures the loss of connectivity - and thus the tracking of the user - when he or she is not in range of the positioning technology.
\subsection{Technologies to research}
Throughout the development of the PoC, several technologies are used, such are: Android \acrshort{sdk}, authentication, RoomDB for offline storage, IBM BlueMix \acrshort{api}, \acrfull{uml}, dependency injection, MapWize, IndoorLocation and Cisco CMX.
