The case study used throughout this thesis is the need for indoor geolocalization and routing inside a hospital muiltifloor environment. In this chapter the needed actions to implement the usage of Cisco CMX inside an android application are discussed. Firstly, the mapping component, being MapWize, is discussed, followed by the part of indoor location tracking and an indoor location framework provided by IndoorLocation. Finally the implementation is concluded with the advantages and disadvantages of using the android platform to develop an indoor location application.
